You are going to do it. The only question is exactly what the location of a vegetable garden will be.</p> <p>Choosing a garden location can seem complicated. How much sun? What kind of soil? How much room? Don’t panic. It is not hard to pick a spot for a vegetable garden as long as you keep a few things in mind.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Convenience</strong></h3> <p>The position of a vegetable garden should first and foremost be chosen for convenience. After all, a vegetable garden is for your enjoyment.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>If you have to walk 10 minutes to the location of a vegetable garden, chances are greatly reduced that your spot for a vegetable garden will be weeded and watered as much as it should and you might miss out on harvesting regularly.</p> <h3><strong>Sun</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-7.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Another thing to consider when choosing a garden location is how much sun that spot gets.<br><br>Be sure to <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/palram-plant-hangers-hg1010" title="PALRAM PLANT HANGERS HG1010 "><strong>hang</strong></a> your upside-down garden somewhere sunny.<br><br>Typically, vegetables need at least six hours of sun, though eight hours is better.<br><br>Don’t fuss so much about if the spot for a vegetable garden gets morning or afternoon sun, just check to make sure it gets six hours total of sun.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Drainage</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Plants can’t grow in waterlogged soil. The position of a vegetable garden should be somewhat elevated.</p> <p>If the location of a vegetable garden is at the bottom of a hill or in an indentation in the ground, it will have a hard time drying out and the plants will suffer.</p> <p>This is where upside-down gardening can be beneficial.

For upside-down gardens, this need not be a factor.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Soil</strong></h3> <p>Soil is not as much a factor in where to put a garden as you might think.<br><br>If you are down to two spots and you are undecided as to which would be best, certainly choose the location with the loamier soil.<br><br>Otherwise, all soils can be improved and, if the soil is bad, you can build raised beds or find amendments at a garden center.<br><br>Now you know a little bit more about where to put a garden in your yard. If you follow these few tips for choosing the position of a vegetable garden, it will be easy to do.<br><br>Remember, the location of a vegetable garden is not as important as having fun while tending it.</p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <br><strong>MAKE A HANGING GARDEN</strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Make a hanging garden of stacked pots! Although it may be blisteringly hot outside, you can now garden underneath the shade of your porch! You can take advantage of <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/how-and-why-indoor-vertical-gardening" title="Indoor Vertical Gardening "><strong>vertical space</strong></a> and shady areas using this quick, easy, and simple method of gardening.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>In the summer, most plant nurseries offer reduced prices for many of their plants (at least in the summer heat of Texas they do).</p> <p>Here's a way to take advantage of those prices and make a space-friendly vertical garden that can be enjoyed anywhere. <br><br><strong>Vertical gardening</strong> helps utilize space in urban settings, allowing you to have more plants in a smaller space.</p> <p>More plants in cities means cleaner air, so get started right away! <br><br> If you don't have a suitable place to hang your garden and/or have high winds that could damage knock them off, you could also choose to use the larger <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Tipsy-Pots-Tower-Planter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tipsy pot tower<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a>that inspired this. </p> <h3> <br><strong>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</strong> </h3> <p>The first step everyone should take when starting a project - gather your supplies.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-10.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <ul> <li> <p>Small to medium-sized pots.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2O2pCxo" target="_blank" title="Iris Culture Soil Potting Flowers and Vegetables " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Potting soil</strong></a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thin galvanized chain (I used a cheap chain fish stringer I had lying around.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Something to keep the end of the chain from coming up out of the bottom of the pot (I used a bolt , a nut and a washer)</p> </li> <li> <p>Somewhere to hang the garden (a hook, a nail, a sturdy branch)</p> </li> <li> <p>Plants (choose plants that have the right light requirements for the area you are hanging it in. For example, if you are hanging it underneath a shaded porch, choose shade-tolerant plants)</p> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-11.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">There are a few things to keep in mind when you choose your materials. <br><br>The chain should be able to fit through the hole in the bottom of your pots.<br><br>The pots can't be too heavy when they are filled and hanging, or they will potentially break and y'all will have a big ol' mess to clean up!<br><br>You should also make sure the number of pots you get can fit on the amount of chain you have.<br><br>Trailing plants like vines would make a good plant on the bottom pot. Flowers can be used in the middle and upper ones.<br><br>Keep in mind you don't have to choose just <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/ornamental-indoor-palms" title="Ornamental Indoor Palms "><strong>ornamental plants</strong></a> and flowers.<br><br>You could also choose herbs such as lemon balm, mint, basil, etc. to be enjoyed in salads and teas or even used for medicinal purposes.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Chain to Hang</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-12.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Since the pots are going to be stacked on the chain, you need something to keep the chain from sliding through.<br><br>It needs to be something large enough so that can't slip through the bottom no matter how it is positioned.<br><br>This is just in case it somehow moves. An easy way to do this is to get a bolt, a nut that fits on the bolt, and a washer that cannot slide off the nut and the large end of the bolt.</p> How to arrange this:<br> 1. Slide the bolt through the bottom link in the chain<br>2. Slide the washer on<br>3. Screw on the bolt<br><br> <ol></ol> <h3><strong>Step 3: Hang Those Pots and Fill Em Up Good! </strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-13.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Believe it or not, this is the most difficult step. Hang the pots alternatively, as shown in the pictures.<br><br>Be very careful not to let the pots drop into the other pots while you stack them, as they might break.<br><br>Carefully lift it up onto the hook and fill them up. It's best to find the permanent spot you want the pots to hang in; after they're filled they are heavy and hard to move and hang again. <br><br>You can choose different sized pots, just make sure that the top is open enough for the plants to grow through.<br><br>For example, you could hang a small pot on top, a larger pot on bottom, and sizes in between the two in the middle to create a cascading look.

Now all you have to do is sit back and enjoy your new hanging garden!<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Grow Vegetables in Hanging Baskets</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/12278/5-great-reasons-to-grow-vegetables-vertically" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-15.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Hanging baskets are a <a href="http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/12278/5-great-reasons-to-grow-vegetables-vertically" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vertical gardening method</a> that not only creates more garden space, but it's also a handy way to add quick color and (surprise) grow more food!<br><br>This is a perfect solution for urban gardeners which, <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/small-space-gardening" title="Small Space Gardening "><strong>due to lack of space,</strong></a> find it necessary to plant predominately in containers.<br><br>But I think that everyone should take advantage of the vertical real estate possible around their home -- no matter how much horizontal space is available.<br><br>Like any other <a href="http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/6877/grow-herbs-in-containers-for-the-winter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">container</a>, hanging baskets are excellent for growing vegetables; but some are especially suited to a contained environment.<br><br>For example, lettuce not only thrives in baskets, but looks gorgeous to boot. Plant several lettuce varieties, a couple of herbs, and some flowers into a hanging basket and you'll have personality and color as well as lunch.<br><br><a href="http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/12278/5-great-reasons-to-grow-vegetables-vertically" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-16.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Don't be afraid to pack in the plants. Young starts can be planted at the open top of the basket or you can cut holes in the liner and tuck plants all over the outside, as well -- it's a stunning effect.<br><br>Perfect places for blossom or crop-filled baskets are by the front door, under house eaves, from fences, balconies, arbors, gazebos, and in trees.<br><br>Visitors will comment on the basket's beauty, but almost never realize that it's loaded with vegetables!<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Which Vegetables Can You Grow in a Hanging Basket?</strong></h3> <p>Eggplants, strawberries, small peppers, cherry tomatoes, and lettuce are all good candidates.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-17.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Chives, mustard greens, cabbage, and many herbs are naturals for hanging baskets, as are the always popular strawberry plants.<br><br>In fact, I've always found that while those strawberry jars look like fun, I've never had a substantial strawberry harvest from them.<br><br>They certainly never come close to what was produced in my hanging baskets.<br><br>Depending on which way your home faces, baskets that are hung under the eaves may be on the shady side of things. <br><br>No worries, not all vegetables worship the sun. Those that are grown for their leaves such as lettuce, spinach, and Swiss chard do quite well living out their lives in part shade.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Hanging Baskets Have Personality</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-18.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Some baskets have the traditional bowl-shaped, wire frames that are often lined with a thick, coconut-fiber shell.<br><br>This uber-strong liner is going to work best of you're planting just the open top part of the basket.<br><br>There's a thinner coco-liner available that can be pierced with scissors, which will allow you to plant from the sides and bottom of the basket, as well.<br><br>This type of <a href="https://amzn.to/2NY0ms0" target="_blank" title="Wall Mounted Rattan Plant Pots,Waven Flower Basket Wall Mounted Hanging Vase Container Plant Hanging Basket" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>hanging basket</strong></a> display makes a bold and beautiful statement once the plants have filled in.<br><br>The wire basket "frames" come in other shapes such as conical and oblong. Some structures are made from bare wire (fabulous for a farm house look) and some are covered with a black, white, or green coating.<br><br>Tall, hanging rods called shepherd's hooks can be purchased if you'd like to dangle your plants above another garden space.<br><br>Long, metal arms that attach to walls and fences can be used to display baskets, too.

Consider geranium, callibrachoa, bacopa, alyssum, marigolds, plumbago, lobelia, daffodils, and verbena.</p> <p>It's one of the best places to show off trailing plants such as dead nettle, sweet potato vine, and black-eyed Susan vine.</p> <p>By the way, if you live in an area with high temperatures, <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/ornamental-cactus-plants-indoors" title="Ornamental Cactus Plants Indoors "><strong>cacti and succulent</strong></a> arrangements make a handsome presentation.</p> <p>Many shade-loving plants thrive in hanging baskets, including fuchsias, impatiens, ferns, pansies, and begonias will bring life (and light) to shady porches.<br><br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Keep in Mind: </strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hanging-vegetable-garden-20.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <div style="text-align: left;">Hanging baskets dry out fairly quickly -- especially if your baskets are situated in the sun -- and may need to be watered daily in hot summer weather.</div> <div style="text-align: left;">This is the case here in Northern California.</div> <div style="text-align: left;">This is the part where we recommend either a drip system or an early morning hand-watering-while-sipping-coffee routine.</div> <p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
