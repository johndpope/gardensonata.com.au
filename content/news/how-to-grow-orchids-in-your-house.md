Most orchid roots need far more air than potting soil would give them, but they still need something to anchor their roots, and so they benefit from a looser, more porous mix.<br><br>You can use <strong>bark chips, sphagnum moss, coconut husks, charcoal, perlite, and even Styrofoam pellets</strong> as potting mix, often in combination.<br><br>And put them in a wall planter if you want to attach the orchids in the wall, and a <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/palram-plant-hangers-hg1010" title="PALRAM PLANT HANGERS HG1010 "><strong>hanging wall planter</strong></a> if you want it hung outside your house or even in the windows.

These can be hung in advantageous locations for better sunlight.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Clear plastic pots</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>These pots will allow your orchids to get better sunlight to the roots. These allow the grower to inspect the root systems without disturbing the orchid<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Wooden pots</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>These are constructed of rot-resistant wood. Just line any wooden pots with sheet moss before adding your potting mixture.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Proper Care for your Orchids</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-7.png" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Orchids that are sold in shops are most probably in bloom when bought them.</p> <p>And like most other people, you would want to prolong their bloom as long as possible. In nature, orchids typically grow on trees and their roots are water-gathering organs that need loads of fresh air flow to be healthy.</p> <p>Orchids with wet roots are susceptible to root rot and other problems. The best way to take care of your orchid is to place it near a south- or east-facing window that receives strong, indirect light.</p> <p>Water your orchid whenever the soil feels dry, and <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2NVSAyX" target="_blank" title="Grow More 300ml Orchid Food" rel="noopener noreferrer">fertilize</a> it once a month while it’s blooming</strong>. Always make sure that the room your orchids are in receives a good circulation, or you can set an overhead fan to low if it doesn’t.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Watering your Orchids properly</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Orchids that are grown indoors are almost put in pots filled with chips of bark, stones, treefern or some other loosely packed material, which keeps their roots well-aerated and permits water to drain quickly. Nothing kills your orchid faster than letting it sit in a water-logged pot, since a lack of oxygen will cause the roots to suffocate and rot. They should be place in a hanging wall planter, or in a pot where there are a lot of holes for drainage. Water orchids thoroughly, usually about once a week, then allow them to dry slightly before watering again. Orchids are better armed to tolerate periods of forgetfulness than they are to being over-watered.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Orchids need a decent amount of Lighting</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The single most important variable when growing orchids indoors is light.<br><br>Most orchids require plenty of light, <strong>preferably at least six hours per day</strong>. However, many orchids can withstand more or less than the amount of light recommended, but providing more light heighten blooming possibilities.<br><br>Conversely, insufficient light prevents orchids from flowering, although they will grow. The leaf color of orchids always indicates if the amount of light is adequate.<br><br>The lush, rich, dark green of most houseplants is not desirable in orchid leaves. Dark green leaves are attractive, but indicates that there is not enough light.<br><br>A grassy green color (light or medium green with yellowish tones) means the plant is receiving sufficient light to bloom. <br><br></p> <h3><strong>Artificial Lights</strong></h3> <p>Where windows with sufficient light are not available, consider d<strong>eveloping your orchids beneath artificial lights</strong>.</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="http://www.aos.org/orchids/additional-resources/orchids-indoors.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Four (4) foot-long <a href="https://amzn.to/2O6nqVL" title="Agrobrite FLT44 T5 Fluorescent Grow Light System 4 Feet 4 Tube "><strong>fluorescent tubes</strong></a> that are placed 6 inches apart side by side should do the trick. And two shop-light fixtures with cool-white bulbs will suffice.<br><br>The grow lights may bring in much better results, although data on this are inconsistent. Place plants 6 to 8 inches below the tubes.<br><br>Put the lights on a timer set to operate the bulbs for <strong>14 to 16 hours a day.</strong><br><br>Most orchids, such as phalaenopsis and paphiopedilums, will be satisfied. Orchids that need more light, such as vandas and cymbidiums, however, need natural sunlight or high-intensity discharge lights to bloom.<br><br>A fluorescent fixture placed in a dimly lit window adds extra light to natural sunlight too, and can mean the difference between flowers and no flowers. Orchids that do not bloom often means they are in need of more light. <br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Creating the Right Temperature</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Another difference between orchids and many <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/house-plants" title="House Plants "><strong>houseplants</strong> </a>is that in nature most orchids experience a big difference between day and night temperatures. <br><br>Most orchids originate from a tropical climate, meaning good air, plenty of light, and 12-hour days (365 days a year).<br><br>The temperature (depending on the species of orchid) should range between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 to 23.8 degrees Celsius).<br><br>Manipulating the temperature of your home is also considered so it will drop at least 10 degrees at night, especially in autumn and winter when most orchids initiate buds, this will induce your orchids to set flower buds more readily.<br><br>You can accomplish this by lowering the temperature on the thermostat. This little trick can mean the difference between an orchid plant that merely lives, and one that thrives and flowers.<br><br>Many of the orchids tolerate exposure to warmer or cooler temperatures without even suffering damage. The temperature groupings refer to the lowest temperature the orchid prefers during winter nights.</p> <p>Warm-growing orchids, such as phalaenopsis, mope if the temperatures drop much below 60 F.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-12.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Intermediate growers, such as cattleyas, prefer winter nights around 55° F and cool-growing orchids, including cymbidiums and odontoglossums, are accustomed to winter nights of 50 F.</p> <p>At the other extreme, most orchids perform poorly when exposed to temperatures above 90° F. As with light, some orchids easily adapt to more than one temperature range.<br><br></p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Food for your Orchids (Fertilizer)</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-13.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Most orchids are not heavy feeders. Many orchids bloom year after year with no fertilizer at all. <br><br><strong>Orchids do not require heavy doses of fertilizer.</strong><br><br>However, to maintain healthy plants and see blooms on a regular basis, apply a weak solution of 20-10-20 fertilizer once every week.<br><br>During your orchids' lively growth and when new leaves are being produced, you may fertilize every other time you water at half the strength recommended on the fertilizer package. <br><br>Decrease the fertilizer dose to one-quarter the strength recommended on the package and when in doubt, give less rather than more.<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-14.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Switch to a <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHnp7o" target="_blank" title="J R Peters Inc 51024 Jacks Classic No.1.5 10-30-20 Blossom Booster Fertilizer" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>blossom-booster fertilizer</strong></a> in the autumn, when many orchids are initiating flower buds.<br><br>Blossom-booster is a fertilizer ratio with higher phosphorus and lower nitrogen, such as a 10-30-20 formula.<br><br>Most orchids are winter bloomers, which makes them even more special as houseplants. They fill an often otherwise flowerless void in the dullest of months.<br><br>Peak of orchid bloom usually occurs between <strong>December and April</strong>.</p> <p>However, it's important to distribute water without fertilizer at least once a month to flush excess fertilizer salts from the bark mix and avoid fertilizer burn to the orchid roots.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Humidifier will be a great help</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-grow-orchids-in-your-house-15.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Most orchids we grow indoors come from the tropics, and most parts of the tropics are much more humid than the average living room. Orchids tend to grow better if you can boost the humidity in their immediate growing area by grouping your plants together, or placing them on a dry well. <br><br><strong>Here are some tricks to increase humidity:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Operate a humidifier near the plants; </p> </li> <li> <p>Place the pots on flat, black pebbles set in a tray in which water is added until it almost covers the stones, group the orchids together; or </p> </li> <li> <p>Cordon off the growing area with <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/collections/green-house-covers/products/thermal-anti-condensate-greenhouse-film-6mil" title="THERMAL ANTI-CONDENSATE GREENHOUSE FILM, 6MIL "><strong>clear plastic</strong></a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><br>An orchid is a beautiful and vibrant addition to your home. They might be complicated to take care of, and a bit difficult for some parts, but if you use the tips mentioned above, it will help your orchids to be healthy and will flourish for a long time.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
