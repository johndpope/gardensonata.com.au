<p>You don't need an estate to grow a gorgeous (and useful!) herb garden. Most herbs are perfect container garden plants and will thrive on your deck, patio, balcony, fire escape, or front steps, provided you offer them the right growing conditions.</p> <p>First and foremost, <strong>herbs need full sun for best performance</strong>. Place your containers in locations that receive <strong>at least eight hours of direct sun</strong>. Grow indoor herbs in the sunniest location you can find, but don't expect them to perform as well as they do outside.</p> <p>Also, don't give your herbs too much love. <strong>Avoid the fertilizer</strong>; most herbs will give you the strongest fragrance and flavor if they're grown in lean soil.</p> <p>Likewise, water wisely; while <strong>most herbs prefer dry conditions</strong>, some need more moisture to thrive.</p> <p>Use a soil-less potting mix to provide excellent drainage and space for roots to grow.</p> <p>Perennial herbs can survive in containers outdoors year-round if the pots are large enough (holding at least 5 gallons of soil), have good drainage, and are hardy in your Zone. Use <strong>plastic pots; <a href="https://amzn.to/2OG8zyc" target="_blank" title="Mini Ceramic Flower Pot " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #38761d;">ceramic or clay containers</span></a></strong> will often crack from freeze-thaw cycles.</p> <p>Or lift your perennial herbs from pots and transplant them into the garden in late summer, giving the herb enough time to establish a new root system to survive winter.</p> <p> You can also treat container-grown perennial herbs as annuals, discarding them at the end of the season.

It is also convenient. Even if you have miles of property and gardens galore, it is really great to be able to step out your door and pick a handful of fresh herbs from a beautiful container garden.</p> <p>It is much easier to turn on my porch light and go out to my pots and snip some fresh herbs. You can grow almost any herb in a container and most are very easy.</p> <p>Herbs can have different water requirements, and some are more finicky than others, so be sure to put herbs that require similar care in the same pot. Don't forget to click here: <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/">gardensonata.com.au<br><br><br></a></p> <h3><strong>Planning Your Herb Container</strong></h3> <p>You can grow as many types of herbs in one container as you want, as long as you make sure that all the herbs in a single pot share the same sun, water, and soil preferences. <br><br> For example, rosemary likes it hot and dry while parsley needs steady moisture. They wouldn’t be perfect in the same pot.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Herbs in Container Garden Design</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/herbs-garden-containers-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Don’t be shy about using herbs as decorative elements in any <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/container-gardening" title="Container Gardening "><strong>container garden.</strong></a><br><br>They can look fantastic and provide a great texture and scent mixed with annuals or perennials.<br><br>Again, just be sure to pair them with plants that have the same requirements for light and water.</p> <h3><strong>Choosing a Container for Your Herbs</strong></h3> <p>You can use almost anything for an herb container, though make sure whatever you choose has good drainage.</p> <p>Most herbs don’t have large root systems so you can get away with smaller containers.</p> <p>This is especially true of the herbs that don’t mind drying out between watering.</p> <p>That said, the smaller the container, the less soil there is, so you have a smaller margin of error when it comes to watering.</p> <p>Some herbs thrive in <strong>self-watering containers</strong> (see also: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Hydroponics:Alternative Methods for Gardeners"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":{"1":0},"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/hydroponics-alternative-method-for-gardeners" title="Hydroponics:Alternative Methods for Gardeners "><strong>Hydroponics:Alternative Methods for Gardeners</strong></a>) </span>because they like a constant level of moisture.</p> <p>Plants like:</p> <ul> <li>Chives</li> <li>Parsley</li> <li>Marjoram</li> <li>Mint</li> </ul> <p>would be particularly good candidates for growing in self-watering pots.</p> <p>Other herbs like:</p> <ul> <li>Oregano</li> <li>Thyme</li> <li>Rosemary</li> <li>Basil</li> </ul> <p>prefer to dry out between watering so wouldn’t be good candidates for self-watering containers.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Planting Your Herbs <br><br></strong></h2> <h3><strong>Light</strong></h3> <p>Most herbs need full sun at least 6 hours a day</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/herbs-garden-containers-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>That said, containers can really bake on a hot day, so if you live somewhere where temperatures soar, your herb containers may need to be shaded during the hottest part of the day.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Soil</strong></h3> <p>Use quality <a href="https://amzn.to/2O2pCxo" target="_blank" title="Iris Culture Soil Potting Flowers and Vegetables " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>high-quality potting soil</strong></a> because most herbs need good drainage.</p> <p>Also, make sure that your container has drainage holes so you don’t drown your herbs.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Fertilizer</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/herbs-garden-containers-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Be careful <strong>not to over-fertilize herbs</strong>. Most don’t like it and some herbs will flat out croak if they are fussed with and overfed.<br><br>Some herbs, like thyme and oregano, thrive on neglect and won’t be as tasty if they are given too much attention, water or food.<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Harvesting Herbs</strong></h3> <p>The <strong>rule of thumb</strong> is <strong>the more you pick, the more you’ll get</strong>. Also, you want to pinch most herbs back to make them bushier and well-formed.</p> <p>That said, some herbs, like basil, you don't want to cut all the way back.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Herbs Indoors</strong></h3> <p>At the end of the season, if you have lots of sun, you can bring many of your herbs indoors.
