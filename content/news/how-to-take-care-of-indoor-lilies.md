They're not very peculiar about the soil type or pH and they would grow well in full sun, part sun, dappled shade and even light shade.</p> <p>True lilies grow from bulbs and can be planted in spring, but getting them into the ground in autumn gives them a head start. </p> <p>Because they are stem rooters and the bulb often anchors a heavy blossom load, it’s important to dig it at least 8 to 10 inches from top of bulb to top of soil. In regions where temperatures skyrocket above 90 degrees F on a daily basis, sink the bulbs an extra 4 inches or so deeper. <br><br></p> <h3>Location (Choosing the right place for Lilies)</h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-take-care-of-indoor-lilies-7.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Lilies are native to shady, moist, and hot tropical rainforests. Therefore in most climates, Lilies cannot be left outside your house all year round (Unless you live in a tropical country where there are no winter seasons.)<br><br>However, inside the safety of your home, where it is usually relatively warm and humid compared to the outside environment, the plant can do well. <br><br>Depending on your climate, you may be able to leave your lily plants outdoors for a part of the year on a shady patio on <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/palram-shelf-kit-hg1007" title="PALRAM SHELF KIT HG1007 "><strong>plant shelves</strong></a> or similar location when the weather is warm and humid. If you happen to live in a tropical location, however, you can safely leave your plant outside on your garden all year-round.<br><br>Plant them in plant containers that are wide enough for them to spread their roots. Almost any <a href="https://amzn.to/2OGmZyp" target="_blank" title="LCG Floral 16G110 Agave in A Terra Cotta Pot " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>pot material</strong></a> would do fine (Such as Ceramic, Clay, and plastic) and make sure that the pot you’re going to use has one or more drainage holes on the bottom. Drainage is very important to plants because the lack of it may result your plant to root rot.<br><br>Use a <a href="https://amzn.to/2OGozAl" target="_blank" title="OUNONA Peat Pellets Compressed Peat Soil " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>peat-based potting soil</strong></a> that contains composted bark, along with sand or perlite. Ideally, your soil should be light and springy (to allow proper drainage) and have very little to no odor. If you’re going to plant your lilies in your garden box, place them in a berm, raised bed to ensure proper drainage.<br><br></p> <h3>Water your Lily Plants Sufficiently</h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-take-care-of-indoor-lilies-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Watering your plants intently would be the best care you could give to your lily plants.<br><br>When the potted soil is dry, add enough water to make it damp, but not so much as to create standing water and too little water will cause your plant to wilt and die.<br><br>Lilies do not like soggy soil. Both the growing medium and the <u>p</u>lant container should have good drainage, and the soil should be allowed to dry out on the surface between watering.<br><br>If you don’t water your plant properly, you should be able to see it visibly droop. However, too much water can cause a condition called root rot which can also be fatal to your plant. Remember to water about once per week, or when the soil is dry. It is sometimes recommended to even wait until the plant has begun to wilt ever-so-slightly before each watering. Use clean room temperature water.<br><br></p> <h3>Sun lights, Sun shines</h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-take-care-of-indoor-lilies-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Lily plants generally like bright, indirect light. Place potted lilies where they receive bright light for six to eight hours daily, supplementing the light with grow bulbs if necessary.<br><br>So, placing them near a <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/rion-6-x-6-ft-sun-room-2-hg7506" title="SUN ROOM"><strong>sunny window</strong></a> where light is filtered by sheers, blinds or <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/collections/green-houses" title="green house "><strong>other protection from direct sun</strong></a> that can cause sunburn would be a good choice.<br><br>Placing the plants within 3 feet of a sunny window provides high light for lilies, while at a distance of 6 feet; the lily is in low light and getting no direct light. Lily plants prefer a room temperature for foliage growth as well as during their blooming. Appropriate temperatures range between 50 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.<br><br></p> <h3>Feeding Lilies</h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-take-care-of-indoor-lilies-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Apart from refreshing water and indirect sunlight, your plant will not need much of maintenance. Fertilizers and nutrient supplements should not be essential to grow a healthy, thriving lily plant.<br><br>However, if you desire to do so (for some instances, because you want to grow your plant exceptionally large, and have vibrant blooms), take care so as not to over-fertilize it, as<strong> lily plants can be somewhat sensitive</strong>.<br><br>Use a standard 20-20-20 house plant fertilizer at one half or one quarter its recommended strength about once per month in the spring and summer, when the plant's growth is most active.<br><br>You can give it every 3 months, and allow the liquid fertilizer to run out the bottom of the pot to help prevent the salt build ups in the growing medium.<br><br></p> <h3>Pests Prevention and cure</h3> <p>Small insects, (such as aphids and mealybugs and even spider mites), loves to attack houseplants of virtually of every kind. These tiny pests suck sap from the undersides of your lily plant’s leaves which can cause spots to form on the upper surfaces.</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-to-take-care-of-indoor-lilies-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">The insects also excrete a sticky substance called honeydew that can drip from the plant onto furniture or flooring. (And can be really messy).<br><br>Placing the lily in the shower or using a kitchen sink sprayer can wash the insects off the plant.<br><br>Use a strong stream of water to blast the pests off of your plant, then, to make sure they don't return, use a plant-safe insecticide.<br><br>Wiping dust off the leaves regularly and misting it can help prevent a visit from spider mites, (A minuscule pests that look like tiny, moving dots). They prefer warm, dry or dusty conditions and some species build small webs among the foliage. It is important to check your plant regularly or every week for pests.<br><br>Growing a Lily plant indoors may not be an easy task, but when you already knew how to take care of them properly, you would be rewarded by vibrantly gorgeous flowers that will make your home feel good and livelier, and your garden turn into a paradise filled with heavenly scents.
