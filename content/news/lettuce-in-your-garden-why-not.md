If you're using a multi-cell seed starting system, plant three or four seeds in each cell. <br><br>Limit your seeds to 4 per pot to avoid overcrowding the lettuce as it grows. If you want to plant more than 4 seeds, prepare several pots ahead of time. Just use a spray bottle in watering them to avoid washing the seeds away.<br><br>If you lack patience, and don’t want to wait for seeds to sprout, you can plant lettuce seedlings instead.<br><br>Use the same technique as you would for lettuce seedlings, planting no more than 4 per pot.

Avoid mid-to-late afternoon harvesting, which is when your plant's least hydrated.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lettuce-in-your-garden-why-not-12.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Regardless of when you harvest lettuce, its tender leaves demand careful handling.<br><br>Harvested greens left in the late spring sun can start to wilt in just 15 minutes, so quickly get them out of the garden and into a cool, moist (but not wet) spot.<br><br>Lettuce is perishable so, cut only what you need. Starting with the outer leaves first, trim each leaf at the plant's base, about an inch from the soil.Leave the remaining leaves to grow again for a few days longer.<br><br>When you are finished harvesting,you can plant another set of seeds.<br><br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Storing Newly Harvested Lettuce</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lettuce-in-your-garden-why-not-13.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p style="text-align: center;">(How to keep Lettuce fresh)</p> <p>Lettuce has a <strong>shorter shelf life</strong> than most vegetables, especially the tender butterhead lettuce variety.</p> <p>It stays in best condition in a humid, cold environment with minimal air circulation.</p> <p>Depending on the variety, lettuce can last anywhere between 3-10 days in the refrigerator.</p> <p>Check how long your specific variety lasts for.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Here are some tips on how to keep your Lettuce fresh:</strong></h3> <h3><strong>Core Removal</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lettuce-in-your-garden-why-not-14.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Iceberg, romaine, and other lettuce with a stiff core last longer when their core is removed. <br><br>Cut out the core with a knife, or just pound the stem against a cutting board firmly, then twist the stem to remove the core by hand.<br><br>Avoid this step if your lettuce is butterhead, or any other lettuce with loose, tender leaves.</p> <h3><strong>Wrap them with paper towels</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>Wrap the head of lettuce, or loose leaves in single layers between two soft, absorbent paper towels.</p> <p>These paper towels will absorb excess water but keep the lettuce in the moist conditions it prefers.</p> <p>If your lettuce feels dry, dampen the paper towels and If they are wet enough to soak the towels, squeeze them out and wrap the lettuce again in the same, moist paper towels.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Store them in a plastic container</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lettuce-in-your-garden-why-not-15.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Store lettuce in a plastic container (Such as zip-locked bag, a hard plastic container, or even a salad spinner).<br><br>If using a bag, press out some of the air before sealing, without bruising the leaves.<br><br>If you’re using a hard container, fill it at least halfway with leaves.<br><br>The more air in the container, the faster you'll get brown edges.<br><br>But if you press out all the air and seal the container completely, it may develop off flavors due to poor respiration. <br><br>Leaving a little air or cracking the container slightly may be a better idea, especially with leaf lettuce or a fridge that's on the warm side.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>The Crisper Drawer</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>Crisper drawer is the coldest part of your fridge, which is ideal for leafy greens.</p> <p>Most grocery store lettuce should last 3-7 days here, depending on freshness, while iceberg may last up to two weeks.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lettuce-in-your-garden-why-not-16.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Homegrown lettuce or from farm stand may even last longer.</p> <p><strong>Avoid storing your lettuce with fruits such as apples and pears</strong>, because they release ethylene gas which can cause spoilage.</p> <p>If there’s excess water from your container, lower your fridge's humidity settings or you ever see ice or some kind of frost in the crisper drawer or on the leaves, raise your fridge's temperature.</p> <p>Growing Lettuce in your own garden is a fun and exciting thing to do. Even though it may take up most of your time taking care of them from seedlings until they are mature enough to be picked, all these efforts really won’t go to waste and everything you have done will all be worth it. Just think about all the benefits you could get from them and the lush and fresh feeling they give to your garden. So, why not start your own lettuce garden now.
