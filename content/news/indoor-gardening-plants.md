<p>From farmers’ markets and Community Supported Agriculture, to urban farms and rooftop gardens, to produce delivery services, more and more people across the U.S. are embracing farm-fresh food.</p> <p>And for good reason: Locally grown produce tends to be better for the environment and for local communities than its store-bought counterparts. Growing food at home also ensures that growers know exactly where their food comes from and how it was grown (no need to worry about deceptive food labeling). If you’re not whipping out the <a href="https://amzn.to/2O1RzFr" target="_blank" title="Steel Blade Sharp Anvil Pruning Shears " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>pruning shears</strong></a> yet, consider this: Learning new skills is good for our brains.</p> <p>Luckily, you don’t need to be a farmer (or even live near a farm) in order to reap the benefits of home-grown produce<strong>.</strong> If you have a sunny window (or two, or five) and a bit of extra time on your hands, then you’re capable of growing your own food right at home. <br><br>Read on for our roundup of 16 easy, healthy plants to cultivate indoors — and how to get them growing!

No wonder these fruits are one of our favorite superfoods!<br> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>How to Grow:</strong></h3> It’s possible to grow an avocado tree <a href="http://www.thehungrymouse.com/2009/09/09/how-to-grow-an-avocado-tree-from-an-avocado-pit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from an avocado pit</a>, but doing so may not yield edible fruit. If you want to eat what you sow, it’s best to <strong>purchase a dwarf avocado plant</strong> (varieties that yield the larger green-skinned fruit or the more common black-skinned fruits are equally good) .<br> <ul></ul> <p>To tend for your tree, add some sand to the bottom of a large, well-draining <span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>pot</strong></span> before filling it with regular potting mix and planting your tree.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>How to Harvest:</strong></h3> <strong>Green varieties</strong> are ready to harvest when the <strong>fruits’ skin turns slightly yellow</strong>, while <strong>darker varieties</strong> are ready when their <strong>skins have turned almost black</strong>. <br><br>Ripe fruits can be left hanging on the tree for a few weeks, but any longer than that and they’ll start to lose their flavor and texture.<br><br> <ul></ul> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Carrots"</strong></h3> <h3></h3> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/indoor-gardening-plants-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3><strong>Why They’re Healthy</strong></h3> Carrots are a good source of a variety of vitamins and minerals, including thiamin, niacin, folate, manganese, potassium, and vitamins B6, A, C, and K. <br><br>They also supply carotenoids, which are a big boon for eye health.<br><br> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>How to Grow:</strong></h3> Purchase carrot seeds and a pot or <a href="https://amzn.to/2OJtGj6" target="_blank" title="Window Box " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>window box</strong></a> that’s at least a foot and a half deep and wide, with drainage holes at the bottom. Fill the <strong>container</strong> to within an inch of the top with a humus-rich potting mix.<br><br> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>How to Harvest:</strong></h3> Carrots are ready for harvest when they’ve grown to about ¾ of an inch across the top (just below the green stem).<br> <ul></ul> <p>If you can’t see the carrot itself, gently brush aside some soil around the stem so you can size it up (Note: Though it may be tempting to see how big carrots can get, they’ll start to lose their sweetness and flavor once they surpass their peak size.).<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Garlic Greens"</strong></h3> <h3></h3> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/indoor-gardening-plants-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3><strong>Why They’re Healthy</strong></h3> <strong>Pungent garlic</strong> is a member of the <strong>cancer-fighting allium family</strong>.
