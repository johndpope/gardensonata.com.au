<p>Indoor gardening is nothing more than the <strong>act of growing plants indoors</strong>. This might be at a residential home, within a business location like an office building or restaurant, or any other enclosed area. <br><br> There are multiple types of <strong>indoor gardening</strong>, including <strong><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/container-gardening" title="Container Gardening ">container gardening</a>, <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/hydroponics-alternative-method-for-gardeners" title="Hydroponics:Alternative Methods for Gardeners ">hydroponic gardening</a></strong>, controlled environment agriculture, <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/how-and-why-indoor-vertical-gardening" title="Indoor Vertical Gardening "><strong>vertical farms</strong></a>, and more. Don't forget to click here: <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/">gardensonata.com.au<br><br><br></a></p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A Guide to Indoor Gardening <br></strong></h1> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3> <br><strong>Sunshine</strong> </h3> <p><strong>Decoding those perplexing tag instructions on light.</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>If the tag says <strong>direct light</strong><em>,</em>the plant needs s<strong>ix or more hours of bright sunshine a day, hitting it head-on</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the tag says <strong>moderate light</strong><em>,</em>the plant needs <strong>bright, direct sunshine only part of the time</strong>—about <strong>four hours a day</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the tag says <strong>indirect light</strong><em>,</em>the plant needs to be <strong>kept a few feet away from pounding sun at all times</strong>. It wants only ambient light.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the tag says <strong>low light</strong><em>,</em>the plant needs <strong>no direct sunshine and little ambient light</strong>. It’s happy in a room that never gets much sun.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><br><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>North-facing windows don’t receive much light, southern windows tend to be sunny for much of the day, and eastern and western windows are sunny for part of the day. <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><br><br></a>But, of course, trees, shrubs, and buildings can block light. <br><br>Get to know the light in your home simply by observing it.<br><br>That’s the best way to figure out what plants you can accommodate and where they should live.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Water</strong></h3> <p>How often should I water my plants?<strong><br></strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Because conditions vary, there’s no way to give hard-and-fast advice like “Water once a week.” Heat and sunlight specific to your home will dry out the soil at different rates. You’ll have to feel the soil with your finger. <br><br> If the plant’s tag says, “<strong>Water steadily or evenly</strong>,” then water whenever the surface of the soil is <strong>dry to the touch</strong>. <br><br> If the tag says, “<strong>Water moderately</strong>,” allow the top inch or so to dry out between watering. One note: <strong>Don’t over water</strong>. It’s as liable to kill a plant as under-watering.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>What’s the best technique for watering?</strong></h3> <p>Thoroughly<strong> saturate the soil</strong> until water comes out the bottom of the pot. (If the water is not reabsorbed within a day or so, empty out the saucer.) When you can, take plants to a sink or a tub and give them a soaking; most plants love this. (African violets are an exception.)<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>How can I remember to water?</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Refill the <a href="https://amzn.to/2OFlDUo" target="_blank" title="Plastic Watering Can" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>watering can</strong></a> (or milk jug or any container you like) each time you finish watering, then leave it out as a reminder.<br><br>This will also allow the water to come to room temperature and give additives (like fluoride) a chance to dissipate. Keep needy plants in plain sight so you don’t forget about them.<br><br><br></p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Plants &amp; Containers:</strong></h1> <h3><strong>Healthy Leaves</strong></h3> <p>When shopping for plants, be selective. Look for <strong>firm, healthy foliage and steer clear of anything too leggy</strong> (with more stem than leaves).</p> <p>Find some inspiration from <a href="https://amzn.to/2OGbBlS" target="_blank" title="RHS Practical House Plant Book:" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Decorating With House Plants</strong></a>, for picks that are available in nurseries or grocery stores near you.

Also, a pot should always have a drainage hole in the bottom.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Smart Materials </strong></h3> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OIjJSW" target="_blank" title="Nursery Pots" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Terra-cotta</strong></a> is a durable classic, but also consider resin or fiberglass.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>These hold moisture longer (moisture evaporates through terra-cotta), which gives you a little advantage if you’re forgetful about watering.</p> <p>To protect floors and furniture, use saucers that are glazed on the inside.</p> <p>(Any glazed dish works just as well.) for more amazing gardening just visit here: <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/">gardensonata.com.au<br><br><br></a></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to Re-pot a Plant</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>As a practice, get your plants out of the plastic pots they’re sold in. Even humble terra-cotta is transforming. Before re-potting, water thoroughly to hold the roots together.<strong> </strong><strong><br></strong></p> <h3><strong> </strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 1:</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">With the stem between your fingers, carefully turn the pot upside down and gently coax the plant out of the pot.</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">(If the plant is root-bound—lots of roots and barely any soil—ease out the roots and trim them by about half.)<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 2:</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Place a stone or a shard of terra-cotta over the new pot’s drainage hole so the soil doesn’t wash out. Put an inch or so of potting mix in the pot. Center the plant inside.<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 3: </strong></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fill in around the roots with <a href="https://amzn.to/2O34RS7" target="_blank" title="Pots Seedling Potting Mix" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>potting mix</strong></a>. Use a chopstick or a pencil to tamp around the roots gently.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Leave a quarter inch of space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot. This will help hold water so it can slowly soak in and thoroughly moisten the soil.<br><br></p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Great Indoor Gardening Supplies:</strong></h1> <h3> <br><strong>Plant Trays</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Your idea of an indoor garden might be a few <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/house-plants" title="House Plants "><strong>houseplants</strong></a> scattered throughout your home or a room that’s dedicated to your green thumb pursuits. <br><br>Whatever your interest or skill level, streamline plant care by investing in the right equipment.<br><br>Check out a few of these items, like these indoor round trays that earn their keep as a humidity tray, drainage saucer or <strong>planting containe</strong><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>r</strong></span> for a miniature garden.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Tiered Plant Stands</strong></h3> <p><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/collections/green-house-covers/products/poly-tex-galvanized-potting-bench-hg2000" title="POLY-TEX GALVANIZED POTTING BENCH HG2000 "><strong>Plant stands</strong></a> showcase your plants with style while taking up very little indoor real estate.</p> <p>Stands with tiers or shelves maximize display options in the smallest possible space.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Cachepots</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/basic-indoor-gardening-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Look for eye-catching <span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>cachepots</strong></span> that can hold—and hide—plain plastic and terra-cotta pots.

Even better: when those plants are also deliciously fragrant.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Azores Jasmine</strong></h3> <p>For intense fragrance, grow this jasmine. It typically flowers spring through fall, but tosses open blooms in winter, too, if growing conditions provide warmth and sun. <br><br> Give it a spot near a southern-facing window.

And it’s no wonder as education about the many benefits of gardening and plant life has been prolific as of late. <strong><br></strong></p> <p><br> Rates of depression, anxiety, obesity, respiratory disorders and many other chronic illnesses are increasing among those living in urban areas. <br><br> General concern over public health and social stability is growing. Thankfully, gardening is a terrific preventative measure which can be taken relatively easily, and generates incredible health and social benefits.</p> <p><strong>Here are some of the most amazing benefits of keeping an indoor garden:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Plants improve our air quality by filtering toxins that get trapped indoors. The improved air quality lowers risk of respiratory disorders, as well as chronic headaches and eye irritation.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Plants teach us how to be attentive and responsive to their needs. This improves our levels of empathy and compassion.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Research in environmental psychology<strong> </strong>has shown that a connection with plants improves human mental well-being as well as productivity levels.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>An indoor garden can provide you with <a href="http://www.powerhousehydroponics.com/grow-your-own-microgreens-for-better-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fresh kitchen ingredients</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Growing your own food reduces our risk of chemical ingestion which you find in foods that have been transported to your local grocery store.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Gardening is an excellent <a href="http://www.powerhousehydroponics.com/green-towers-team-creates-solutions-for-urban-food-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation starting point</a> in gaining more attention about the need for improving our environmental impact.</p> </li> <li> <p>In an indoor environment, gardening is a lot less maintenance and plants are relatively safe from pests and disease.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are countless <a href="http://www.powerhousehydroponics.com/?s=automated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated indoor gardening systems</a> for you to choose from which are cost effective and low-maintenance.</p> </li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ol style="padding-left: 30px;"></ol> <ol style="padding-left: 30px;"></ol> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ol></ol> </div> <ol></ol> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Remember:</strong></h3> <p>Indoor gardening can be small in scale and done by the average homeowner, or it can be industrial in scale and occur in massive greenhouses. Keep in mind that, whether it takes place indoors or outdoors, all methods of gardening require access to clean water, a source of light, and a way to support plants as they grow.
