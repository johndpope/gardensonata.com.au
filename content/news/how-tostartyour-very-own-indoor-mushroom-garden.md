<p>(<strong>Making your very own mushroom garden in your house</strong>)</p> <p>Do you like mushrooms? Many of us, probably gardeners might be wondering if it is possible to grow mushrooms in the safety of your home, right? Well, the answer is a big yes.</p> <p>These curious but tasty fungi are typically grown indoors rather than in the garden. You can purchase <a href="https://amzn.to/2xFYIky" target="_blank" title="Mini Mushroom Growing Kit" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>mushroom growing kits</strong></a>, but it is also possible to set up your own area for growing mushrooms.</p> <p>But do you also know that you can grow a lot of high-value mushrooms in un-used spaces, and that it can be quite quick to learn?</p> <p>If not, then let me tell you a bit about it. Growing mushrooms at home is a task that any gardener interested in growing their own food should attempt.</p> <p>Mushrooms are a healthy addition to any diet, as they are low in calories and fat, high in fiber, and contain high amounts of potassium and selenium.</p> <p>Mushrooms are best grown indoors where the temperature and light conditions can be more readily managed. Learning how to grow mushrooms indoors is a matter of managing their growing conditions carefully.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Grow Fast, Grow Anywhere</strong></h3> <p>(Where do Mushrooms usually grow?)</p> <p style="float: right;">Mushrooms can be found thriving on the mossy bark of trees and the shady soil beneath the umbrage of plants, preferring the dark and damp areas of the wild. Mushrooms prefer dark, cool, moist, and humid growing environments.<br><br><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>In a house, a basement is often ideal you can put some <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/palram-shelf-kit-hg1007" title="PALRAM SHELF KIT HG1007 "><strong>plant shelves</strong></a> in it, but a spot under the sink may be all you’ll ever need.<br><br>In contrary to many green plants that go through the process of photosynthesis (converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food), mushrooms receive their energy and nutrients completely from metabolizing dead or decaying organic matter or by absorbing nutrients from the roots of a living plant.<br><br>If this is your first attempt in trying to grow a mushroom, then you may want to purchase a kit to become better acquainted with the basics of fungi culture.<br><br>Check the temperature of the room that you’re going to use. Most mushrooms grow best in temperatures between 55 and 60 degrees F, away from drying, direct heat, sunlight and drafts (or instead use a <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/collections/lean-to-greenhouses" title="LEAN-TO GREENHOUSES "><strong>lean-to greenhouse</strong></a>, just like this one at <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/">gardensonata.com.au</a>).<br><br>Many basements are too warm in the summer to grow mushrooms, so you might want to reconsider growing mushrooms as your <strong>winter project</strong>.</p> <p>Mushrooms can tolerate some light, but the spot you choose should stay <strong>relatively dark or in low light</strong>.</p> <p>Some mushroom types grow outdoors in prepared ground or logs, a process that takes much longer (six months to three years) than in controlled environments inside.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Choosing Which Mushroom to Grow</strong></h3> <p>(Types of Mushrooms and some of its Facts.)</p> <p>Is Mushroom a plant or fungi?</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/mushrooms/grow-mushrooms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Well...

These mature mushrooms produce microscopic spores that are similar to pollen and seeds.<br><br>There are many kinds of mushrooms. One of the beauties of growing your own mushroom instead of wild-harvesting them is that you can be sure you're not picking and going to eat a poisonous mushroom.<br><br>Before you start growing mushrooms inside your house, decide first what kind of mushroom you’ll be growing.<br><br>There are three popular types of mushroom that are commonly grown in houses.</p> <p>And these are:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://draxe.com/shiitake-mushrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiitake mushroom</a></li> <li>Oyster mushroom</li> <li>White button mushroom</li> </ul> <p>Buy a spore or spawn of your chosen mushroom from a reputable dealer (Which of them can be found online).</p> <p>For the purposes of mushroom growing at home, think of spores as seeds and spawn as seedlings. Spawn is easier to handle and grow mushrooms at home.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Different mushrooms have different growing mediums:</strong></h3> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <strong>Shitake mushrooms</strong> are normally grown on hardwoods or hardwood sawdust,<br><br><strong>Oyster mushrooms</strong> on straw, and<br><br>White <strong>button mushrooms</strong> are on composted manures.<br><br>Mushrooms do not contain leaves (absence of chlorophyll pigment) so as to perform photosynthesis process, so it does not require full sunlight to thrive and can also grow in cool, dark growing conditions at home.<br><br>They have some specific light, water, and growing requirements to produce the mushroom. So, Literally Mushrooms do not really need sunlight to grow.<br><br><br> <h3></h3> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shiitake Mushroom</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Shiitake mushrooms have been a popular food source in Asia, for almost a hundred of years.</p> <p>They’re the second most popular and the third most widely cultivated edible mushrooms in the world.</p> <p>Today, this kind of mushroom can be found in most grocery stores because of their meaty and versatile flavor, but did you know?</p> <p>Shiitakes are <strong>packed with B vitamins</strong> and have the <strong>power to fight cancer cells</strong>, <strong>cardiovascular disease and infections</strong>.

It is used much like a plant seedlings to facilitate growth.<br><br>You can also purchase high-quality mushroom spawn from several online retailers, some gardening supply stores, or some specialty organic living stores.<br><br>Just make sure to buy a spawn rather than spores. Some retailers will also sell spores, which are more akin to the seeds of plants (rather than seedlings).<br><br>Growing mushrooms from spores takes more time and practice, and is best suited for a seasoned mushroom grower.

All you need to do keep the bag in the correct conditions and put it in <a href="https://amzn.to/2NY0s2Q" target="_blank" title="Glass Hanging Planter " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>plant hangers</strong></a> or in some <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/palram-heavy-duty-shelf-kit-hg1019" title="PALRAM HEAVY DUTY SHELF KIT HG1019 "><strong>plant shelves.</strong></a><br><br>In seven to 10 days you'll have homegrown mushrooms.<br><br>Kits will usually cost between $20 and $30 and can be used to grow most of the common mushroom varieties such as white button, crimini, portobello, lion's mane, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms.<br><br>Your mushrooms will begin to sprout after a week or 10 days the most, but you can expect to see two or three flushes of growth over a three month period.<br><br>The great thing about these kits is that after they have finished producing mushrooms, you can bury them outdoors under bark mulch or in your compost pile. Then, depending on weather conditions, mushrooms may start to pop up in that spot again.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Sterilizing the growing substrate</strong></h3> <p>If you are growing mushrooms in a straw or sawdust, it is also necessary to sterilize these growing mediums before inoculating with the spawn.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>This process is made to kill micro-organisms that can compete with mycelia. You can do it by placing it in a microwave safe bowl with enough water to make the straw or sawdust damp, heat on until the water boils. Heat the substrate so that the mycelia will spread. </p> <p>The mycelia in your mushroom spawn need to spread into the substrate thoroughly before producing mushrooms, and a warm temperature encourages this growth.</p> <p>Leave it in a dark environment like a cabinet for about three weeks. This will allow the mushroom mycelia to permeate the substrate.</p> <p>Check it after two weeks if it has been fully colonized. In about three weeks, you should see small mushrooms appearing.<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mushrooms are Ready for Harvesting</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-10.png" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Continue to keep their environment moist, cool, and dark to encourage their growth. When you see that their mushroom caps have already separated fully from their stems, they are now ready to harvest.</p> <p>You can pluck the mushrooms out with your fingers, but the risk of damaging the newly developing fungi beneath the surface is great.</p> <p>Instead, use a sharp knife to cut the mushrooms at the base of the stem.It is best to rinse the mushrooms before cooking or eating. You can store harvested mushrooms in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to a week.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Storing your Mushrooms</strong></h3> <p>(How to properly store fresh and newly harvested Mushrooms)</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/how-tostartyour-very-own-indoor-mushroom-garden-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Freshly picked mushrooms will stay good for days if stored right. Store fresh mushrooms the right way, and they'll stay good for up to a week.<br><br>It's easy. Just place the whole, unwashed mushrooms in a brown paper bag and fold the top of the bag over to seal it. Then stick the bag in the main compartment of your refrigerator.<br><br>This works because the bag absorbs excess moisture from the mushrooms so they don't get soggy or moldy. Mushrooms also freeze well, but it's best to get them in the freezer as soon as you can.<br><br>Don't wait for your mushrooms to start deteriorating in the fridge before you decide to freeze some.<br><br>Avoid placing mushrooms near foods with strong odors or flavors because they'll absorb them like a sponge.<br><br>If you have a large mushroom haul, be careful about setting some aside for eating right away and others for eating later. Try to be realistic on how many you'll eat in the next week so you can freeze the rest before they get saggy.</p> <p>Mushrooms need to be cooked before they're frozen. This will stop the enzyme action, thereby preserving their quality, so it's important not to skip this step.<br>See also: <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/grow-herbs-in-your-own-kitchen-garden" title="How to Grow Your Own Herbs in Your Own Kitchen Garden"><strong>How to Grow Your Own Herbs in Your Own Kitchen Garden<br><br></strong></a></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Tips on Growing your Mushroom</strong>s</h3> <p><a href="http://homegardeners.in/mushrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mushroom care </a>is a very easy but requires a lot of patience until you get the right one.
