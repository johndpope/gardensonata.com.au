A good potting soil for palm trees is a mixture of half peat moss and half perlite. The pot should always have a hole at the bottom for excess water to drain out. Place it under a window, near the door, or anywhere inside your house that <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/products/rion-6-x-6-ft-sun-room-2-hg7506" title="RION 6 X 6 FT. SUN ROOM 2 HG7506 "><strong>receive a lot of sunlight</strong></a>.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Give your palm plant food</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;">Always make sure that your palm plant is getting enough nutrients by giving it some fertilizer.<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/ornamental-indoor-palms-7.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Choose a fertilizer that is <strong>specifically made for palm trees</strong> and mix it in with the soil. <br><br>Apply fertilizer only once every six to eight weeks during the growing season and stop applying fertilizer in the late fall.<br><br>Begin fertilizing again in the spring when the palm starts a new growing cycle.<br><br><strong>Too much fertilizer can harm indoor palms</strong> and, like improper watering, can cause brown leaf tips and margins. (Too much is also bad).<br><br>When fertilizer builds up and the soil is allowed to dry out, it can cause leaf burn.<br><br>Palms require a slow-release or diluted liquid fertilizer, but only when plant is actively growing.<br><br>The active growth period for palms is from late winter through early fall. If you are unsure about how much fertilizer to use, it is best to under-feed than over-feed the plant with fertilizer.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Water your Plant properly</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/ornamental-indoor-palms-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Proper watering is essential to the health of an indoor palm. If a plant doesn't get enough water, it can suffer from dried leaves and brown leaf tips and margins.<br><br><strong>Water your palm tree weekly</strong>.<br><br>Do not let the soil dry out, but if it is already soggy and moist when you go to water the palm, you do not need to water as much that week.<br><br>Mist the entire plant every couple of weeks, to remove dust from the leaves that would wash away in the rain if the plant were outdoors.<br><br>Palms need to be kept damp, but you should never allow them to dry out or sit in water.<br><br>You can allow the soil of your palm plant to dry out a little below the surface between watering during active growth and allow the soil to become dry out a little deeper between watering in winter.<br><br>When you do water, pour water until it comes out the drainage tray and then immediately empty the tray. Good drainage is essential to you plant palm.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Temperature is also important for your palm plant</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/ornamental-indoor-palms-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Few palms will thrive in colder temperatures, and some, like the coconut palm, can't tolerate any cold at all.<br><br>Most palms are much more tolerant of shade than you might think. Right temperature is also important for your indoor palms.<br><br>Their ideal temperature is between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and about 60 F when the night comes.<br><br>The exception to this is when plants are not actively growing in winter. In winter, the plants can endure cooler temperature of 55 to 60 F.<br><br>Palms that are kept too cool show signs of cold injury, which includes brownish-red areas on the leaves. To prevent this chilling injury, keep your palm plants in a room with a temperature above 45 F and away from windy areas, (such as near air-conditioning units, electric fans, windows and doors).<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Re-potting</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/ornamental-indoor-palms-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Consider re-potting only if your palm plant is completely pot bound. Palms often have hollow root systems, and they don't like being disturbed. In short, re-pot only when needed.<br><br>Those with a lot of horticultural experience (check this book <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"RHS Small Garden Handbook: Making the most of your outdoor space (Royal Horticultural Society Handbooks) Kindle Edition\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":{"1":0},"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2OGjMi4" target="_blank" title="RHS Small Garden Handbook: Making the most of your outdoor space " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RHS Small Garden Handbook: Making the most of your outdoor space - amazon</strong></a> </span>as it may also help you)know most plants and trees do not like to be root bound, and cramped roots can make the plant less happy and healthy.</p> <p style="float: left;"><br>Also, infrequent re-potting slows the growth rate of palms that might rapidly outgrow your room.Palms are quite different in this regard and seem to almost rather be root bound than otherwise. Their roots do not seem to suffer from overcrowding until there is far less soil than there are roots in a pot, and in plastic pots they will usually rip through the pot walls when it is time to re-pot them.<br><br>However, those palm plants that are kept in ceramic pots will rarely be able to do this. <br><br>If you decide to plant a palm in such a pot, one either needs to get a fairly large pot so re-potting will not be necessary (unfortunately this means over-potting so careful watering these palms), or a cheap <a href="https://amzn.to/2NYu8ge" target="_blank" title="Dulcii Garden Planting Grow Bags, Fabric Aeration Plant Container,Heavy Duty Fabric Grow Pots, Heavy Harvest Planter Raised Bed" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ceramic pot</strong></a>, (Which usually those pot ended up broken to get the palm out of it.<br><br>A good adjustment is to keep your palm plant in a plastic pot until it grows and rip itself out of it, and then place that pot into a ceramic one (this is how most of the professional indoor landscapers proceed).<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Common indoor Palm Plant problems that you might encounter</strong></h3> <p>Brown tipping and leaf loss are probably the most common problem the palm plant might encounter. </p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/ornamental-indoor-palms-11.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>This can be caused by a number of situations (such as too low humidity, poor water quality and or salt build-up in the soil, over-watering with poorly draining soils, under watering with extremely well-draining soils, and excessive heat or cold. </p> <p>There are also some palms that are more resistant to brown tipping than others, and those are usually the ones most commonly encountered in nurseries. </p> <p>But if one takes care to avoid salt build up, waters carefully and mists the plants regularly, many palms will continue to look good.</p> <p>So, if you are considering on having a new houseplant, then you might want these indoor palm plants.</p> <p>They’re not just tropical and exotic looking plants, it is also very easy to take care, very easy to grow and of course, this plant will give your house a spruce vibe.
