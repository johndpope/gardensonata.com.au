<p>You don't need a lot of space to grow fresh vegetables, herbs and fruits. You don't really even need a garden. Plant breeders know that after taste, home gardeners want a high yield in a small space, so they've been developing more varieties that can grow in a small foot print or even live in containers all year long. </p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>The Small Vegetable Plot:</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Vegetable gardening used to be the poor relation of ornamental flower gardens.<br><br>Perennial borders reigned and large, messy, vegetable gardens were hidden in the back yard, usually the domain of the man of the house.<br><br>Vegetable gardens were about producing food, not beauty.<br><br>Now that vegetables have taken a more prominent place on the table, they are gaining more respect in the gardening world.<br><br>And with the increased interest from home gardeners, there has been a surge in the development of new varieties: colorful novelty vegetables, heirlooms, ethnic varieties and compact growers.

You do need good soil, plenty of sunshine, a water source and probably a fence.<br><br>If you think the deer love your Hostas, the entire woodland community is going to enjoy your vegetable garden. If you plant it, they will come.<br><br>If you have a small sunny spot in your yard, or even on your patio, you can grow vegetables. Here's how to get started.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sitting Considerations</strong></h2> <h3> <strong>Sun:</strong> </h3> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cole-crops-1403433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Vegetables need a good 6 or more hours of sun each day. Without sun, the fruits will not ripen and the plants will be stressed.<br><br>Even if you are sun challenged, there are a few vegetables that can survive in light shade, <strong>lettuce and other greens, broccoli and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cole-crops-1403433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cole crops</a></strong>.

Without regular water, vegetables will not fill out and some, like tomatoes, will crack open if suddenly plumped up with water after struggling without for awhile.<br><br>You can't always rely on rain. If you have the means, a <strong>drip irrigation system</strong> is a definite plus for a vegetable garden.<br><br>The new component systems are really quite easy to install and cost a lot less than most people think.<br><br>And you'll save money on water, because it goes directly to the plant's roots. Less is lost to evaporation.<br><br>If you don't want to opt for drip irrigation, try and site your vegetable garden near a water spigot. You'll be more likely to water if you don't have to drag the hose out.

There's no rule that says you can't mix the two.<br><br>It can be a bit harder to harvest, but many vegetables are quite ornamental in their own right.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Growing Up: </strong></h3> <p>If you do opt for a variety of vegetables in your garden, we would recommend the compact varieties and also vining crops that can be trained up on supports.</p> <p><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/tower-garden" title="Tower Garden "><strong>Pole</strong></a> beans take up less space than bush beans.</p> <p>Vining cucumbers and squash, as aggressive as they can be, actually take up less area than their bush cousins.<br><br></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Companion Planting:</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Companion planting is often touted for the benefit of cutting down on pest infestations, but it also serves well to conserve space.</p> <p>Shade tolerant plants will benefit from being planted next to taller crops. </p> <p>Basil likes a respite from hot sun and does well next to tomatoes.</p> <p>Lettuce will keep producing all summer if shaded by almost any taller plant.</p> <p>Early harvested vegetables, like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-spinach-1403448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spinach</a>, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-radishes-in-the-home-vegetable-garden-1403477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radishes</a> and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-organic-peas-2540010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peas</a>, can be planted with slower growing crops like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-broccoli-plants-in-the-vegetable-garden-1403457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broccoli</a> or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-peppers-in-the-vegetable-garden-1403465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peppers</a>, which will not take over the space until the spring harvested vegetables are gone. <br><br> Companion planting is an art and it can be one of the more fun challenges of gardening.</p> <p>Why limit it to the vegetable garden. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/interplanting-flowers-and-herbs-in-the-vegetable-garden-1402759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mix your vegetables and flowers</a>.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Succession Planting:</strong></h3> <p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/succession-planting-1403366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Succession planting</a> is a great technique for any vegetable garden large or small, but it is all the more valuable when space is limited.</p> <p>Succession planting means reseeding quick growing crops every 2-3 weeks during the growing season.</p> <p>It is especially popular with crops like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-green-beans-1403459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beans</a>, zucchini and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-fresh-delicious-lettuce-1403404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lettuce</a>, that tend to exhaust themselves producing so much.</p> <p>By successively planting, you will have just enough produce for your family's appetite and you'll have it all summer, not all at once.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A Downside to a Small Vegetable Garden</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Crop Rotation is a great tool for keeping pests and diseases out of the vegetable garden.

The variety is recommended by Susan<br><br>Romanoff of Gardener's Supply Company, who grows them in an elevated raised bed in her northern Vermont garden.<br><br>"Perfect scale! Slightly draping but not so long or heavy that they reach low to the ground," she says.<br><br>Fruit ranges from the size of a marble up to a golf ball. It has good tomato flavor — not candy-sweet like some cherry tomatoes.<br><br>Plants are relatively tolerant of drought and the fruit is less prone to the cracking and <a href="https://www.gardeners.com/how-to/blossom-end-rot/5354.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blossom-end rot</a>, which frequently afflicts the full-sized tomato varieties.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Mesclun</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-16.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The word mesclun means miscellaneous greens, attributed to wild weeds once foraged by peasants in Europe to supplement their limited diets.<br><br>Many of the mixtures found today are made up of quick-growing arugula and mustards, and are <strong>not ideal for containers</strong>.<br><br>However, you can create your own <strong>container-friendly</strong> mesclun. Consider Italian endives and escaroles, which can be harvested leaf by leaf.<br><br>Or, try purslane, which has unusual, succulent leaves that are high in omega 3 fatty acids.<br><br>Seed companies offer mixes that are suited to the season, so you can start with a spring mix.<br><br>After harvest, replant with a blend that can withstand summer heat, followed by a third planting of fall greens, such as cold-tolerant kale and collards.<br><br>Seed for mesclun is widely available, including mixes such as Wrinkled Crinkled Crumpled Cress and Purple Rapa Pop Mix.</p> <p>By the way, Purple Rapa is a cold-season salad mix selected for solid purple leaves, cold hardiness, and disease resistance.</p> <p>Best color will manifest between the fall and spring equinoxes.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Lettuce</strong></h3> <p>Lettuce comes in all shapes, sizes and colors, and the key to a great-looking container garden is to mix it up.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-vegetables-gardening-17.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Plant different types of lettuce, starting with Little Gem, a mini romaine that forms a sweet, dense heart.
