Please</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/grow-herbs-in-your-own-kitchen-garden-12.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p style="text-align: center;">(Watering your Herbs)</p> <p>Sparingly water your herb plants. Herbs don't like to sit in too wet soil. Make sure to drain the saucers, when a lot of excess water accumulates, and test to see if the containers need water by poking your finger into the soil. If it feels dry an inch or two below the surface, it's time to water. If not, let them be. Although outdoor plants tend to need more water in the summer, indoor plants can dry out quickly when the heat is on in the winter.The right water regime is crucial for plants to thrive.</p> <p>Water is an area where one size does not fit all. You have to experiment for a couple of weeks to see what watering schedule each of your plants need.</p> <p>After a few tests, you'll have a good idea of how often you need to water your herbs, for the time being, just be careful to keep up your detective work as the seasons change.</p> <p>Once you turn on the heat in winter or the air-conditioning in summer, start opening windows, or move your plant, chances are its watering needs will also change.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Herbs also needs Vitamins</strong></h2> <p>(Giving your herbs fertilizers and using good potting soil)</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/grow-herbs-in-your-own-kitchen-garden-13.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Just like us humans, our plant herbs also need nutrients in their soil and occasionally through the addition of fertilizer.<br><br>The best type of fertilizer to use for herbs is either <strong>seaweed extract or fish emulsion.</strong>They are usually less prone to needing frequent feedings, but they will still need a quality potting mix and some fertilizer incorporated into their water occasionally.<br><br>If you are seeing a lot of wispy, delicate growth, lessen the amount or frequency of fertilizer.<br><br>If your herbs look like they are struggling, give them a bit more of it.<br><br>You will need to adjust your fertilizer schedule with the seasons, and in general, they will grow slower in winter than in summer and will need less food then.<br><br>If you are over wintering outdoor potted herbs inside, be sure to check them for pests before you relocate them.<br><br>You should also stop fertilizing them as frequently as they will be experiencing some shock from the move and won't need as much nourishment over the winter anyway.</p> <p>Herbs have more concentrated flavor if they are grown without a lot of fertilizer.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>The Fruits of Labor</strong></h2> <p>(Harvesting of Herbs from your Indoor Garden)</p> <p>Although larger leaves are the most tempting to eat as it may seems they're the oldest ones, they're also the plant's solar panels.</p> <p>If you only prune off mature leaves your plant will have a difficult time growing.</p> <p>Make sure you mix it up by cutting off a mix of mature and brand new leaves (and never cut off all the leaves at once).</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/grow-herbs-in-your-own-kitchen-garden-14.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">As a general rule, herbs that are grown for their leaves should be harvested before their flowers bloom.

It’s okay to prune a perennial to about half its height.<br><br>You can cut back an annual even more — to just a few inches.
