<p>You can do a lot with a little. With a little yard, a little time and a few great plants, you can expand your home into the outdoors by creating a great small garden. A few steps will help you choose the right plants.</p> <p>“Begin by measuring out and planning the space, “ said landscape designer, Susan Cohan, APLD. The plan doesn’t have to be fancy. It should just be a guide to help you understand and design the space.</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-gardening-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Before sketching out your ideas, decide how you will use the garden. Do you want a private outdoor library or an intimate space for entertaining? Most small gardens are enclosed on one side by a building. In urban environments, they can be enclosed on two or more sides. Buildings cast deep shadows as the sun moves around them. Don't forget to click here: <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/">gardensonata.com.au</a> <br><br>Cohan suggests taking some time to closely observe the amount of shade. She said people often think they have a sunny garden when in fact there is a great deal of shade. <br><br>Understanding light levels in your garden allows you to choose the right plants for either sun or shade.<br><br>Next, Cohan said its time to look for gardening opportunities. “<a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/how-and-why-indoor-vertical-gardening" title="Indoor Vertical Gardening "><strong>One opportunity is vertical</strong></a>. <br><br>Gardening up rather than horizontally,” said Cohan.<br><br><strong>Trellises and walls can be used to grow vines</strong>. If there are walls or fences, consider attaching <a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/blogs/news/container-gardening" title="Container Gardening "><strong>containers for growing</strong></a>. Think of adding artwork or found objects to walls or fences to add personality. Add<strong> vertical dimension</strong> by varying levels in the space. Build a raised bed or create a sunken garden. <br><br>Small gardens don’t require using all small plants. It’s important to play with scale and vary heights. Cohan likes to add at least one big plant to a small garden.<br><br><a href="https://gardensonata.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-gardening-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Adding very large plants, when appropriate, adds mystery.<br><br>A <strong>large plant blocks</strong> part of the space from view so that walking the garden becomes a process of discovering new and interesting aspects. <br><br>Smaller gardens contain fewer plants so choose plants with extra character. Don’t plant any one hit wonders. Cohan says to look for plants with the <strong>“big three” traits</strong>. These traits are interesting foliage, whether evergreen or not, a long bloom time, whether blooming or not, and interesting bark. <br><br><strong>Use foliage plants</strong> – like coleus- that look great all season. <br><br>Leave seed and flower heads on for winter interest.<br><br>Plants with at least two of the big three traits provide more impact per plant and make the most of limited space.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tips for Gardening in Small Spaces </strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/small-space-gardening-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>You don’t need a sprawling yard to enjoy gardening.
