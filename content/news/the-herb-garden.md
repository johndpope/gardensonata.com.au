Almost all herbs will grow for at least one season. <br><br>Some will grow year after year. Some common herbs that people grow when first starting an herb garden are, the following:</p> <ul> <li>Basil</li> <li>Chives Mint</li> <li>Dill</li> <li>Oregano</li> <li>Rosemary</li> </ul> <ul></ul> <ul></ul> <h3> <br><strong>Planting and Growing Herbs</strong> </h3> <p>Herbs can be started from seed or planted as plants. Planting herb plants is easier than starting them from seed, but if you are on a tight budget, starting herbs from seeds is not that difficult.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-herb-garden-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Once you have planted your herb garden, make sure that it gets 2 inches of water every week. Also make sure to harvest your herbs frequently. <br><br> Many times when a <strong>new gardener</strong> is starting an herb garden, they are afraid that harvesting the herbs frequently will hurt them. <br><br> Actually, the <strong>opposite is true</strong>. Frequent harvesting of herbs will result in the herb plant producing more and more foliage, which increases the amount you are able to harvest.</p> <p> At the end of the season, you can also dry or freeze your herb harvest so you can enjoy home-grown herbs all year round. Taking the time to plant an herb garden is very satisfying and easy.
